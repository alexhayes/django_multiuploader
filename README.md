# Django Multiuploader Plugin

Multiple uploads for Django using jQuery File Upload (created by Sebastian Tschan https://blueimp.net/).


It uses jQuery UI and jQuery instead of Flash uploader.

On Django side it uses sorl-thumbnails and PIL to generate image previews, however 
other file types can also be uploaded.

You can use it in your applications with simple inclusion tag.

## WARNING

This is a heavily modified fork of https://github.com/garmoncheg/django_multiuploader and is currently in a beta state.

More documentation to come as it moves into a release candidate.
